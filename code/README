Open the project in Atmel Studio to debug on target or build binaries. The board has a 3-pin header for DebugWire access for in-system programming and debugging, but it's still wise to mount a socket so you can take the chip out and reprogram with SPI.

You need to set the fuse to 16MHz internal clock rather than 8MHz.

The Makefile builds for linux and generates a wav for preview.

To configure using avrdude and usbtiny:

# Set fuses to defaults (not required)
avrdude -c usbtiny -p attiny85 -U lfuse:w:0x62:m -U hfuse:w:0xdf:m -U efuse:w:0xff:m

# Set 16mhz clock and other required fuses
avrdude -c usbtiny -p attiny85 -U lfuse:w:0xe1:m -U hfuse:w:0xdf:m -U efuse:w:0xff:m

# Upload binary
avrdude -c usbtiny -p attiny85 -U flash:w:synth.hex
