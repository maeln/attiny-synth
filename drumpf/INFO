HOWTO

Put 22k sample/sec WAV files in in/*
Run main.m in matlab
C++ header-files suitable for our attiny synth are produced in export/*
Compile and run play_all.cpp to produce decompressed wav files to see how much porridge was produced.


PRINCIPLE

Signal is split into a bass and a treble portion at around 800 Hz

Bass portion is downsampled to 1/16x resolution and compressed using a homemade ADPCM algorithm
Treble portion has constant filter coefficients and an exponential falloff fitted to it, so decompression is just noise, filter, falloff
